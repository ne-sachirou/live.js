live.js

Like jQuery().delegate() and Zepto().delegate()

Not like jQuery and Zepto, we only implements one simple feature,
and fully annotated.

We support only latest versions of web browsers on desktop and mobile.

Please use with polyfills.

Recommended polyfills:

- Pointer Events: Hand.js http://handjs.codeplex.com/
- polyfills: Platform https://github.com/Polymer/platform
